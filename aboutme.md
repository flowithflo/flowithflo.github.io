Nice to have you here! My name is Flora. 

### What brings me here

The aspiration engagned through my own self-care journey, after having followed a method of dry brushing for some years from Ayurvedic technique to improve my body's lymphatic flow, it shows not only neurological health advantages, immunity responses benefits and more. This has led me keenly in further learning wanting to know how our lymphatic system works.
In 2024, I begain two parallel studies in the program of lymph therapy (MYOS Opleidingen, the accredited training institute in Utrecht) and the porgram of basic medical knowledge, to widely broadening my horizon in human anatomy, phsyiology and pahtology (TCMA, Traditional Chinese Medicine Academie Nederland). Both works hand in hand for a fuller deep understanding of how our body functions and how to work with for the best bet.




It is with the subtile movments, in guiding your inner lymphatic stream back to its balance

Happy Lymph = Healthier Immunity
