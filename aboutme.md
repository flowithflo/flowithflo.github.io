Nice to have you here! My name is Flora. 


Dr. Vodderâ€™s Manual Lymph Drainage  is the method of my present training at Myos Opleidingen6 which I am learning and following, aiming to become a certified lymphology therapist (by mid-April 2025). Thank You for your support and being part of my learning journey, this will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. Regularly re-training will be part of my continuous professional developments with the purpose of keep up my expertise and to learn new techniques to be able to treat (future) patients with lymphoedema (swelling) & lipoedema (fatty tissue) issues. 

It is with the subtile movments, in guiding your inner lymphatic stream back to its balance
Happy Lymph = Healthier Immunity


### What bring me here

My journey of self-care has led me to further learning. I have a strong interest in understanding how our lymphatic system works, having followed a method of dry brushing from Ayurvedic technique to improve my body's lymphatic flow, which also helps for neurological health. At the beginning of this year, I undertook programmes with MYOS Opleidingen, which provided a solid foundation in classical massage technique and lymfetherapie (manuele lymfedrainage). I have learnt a lot but I feel there is still more to know so I can have a deeper understanding of how our body functions and how to work with improvements for the best results.
