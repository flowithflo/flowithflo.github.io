Nice to have you here! My name is Flora. 

### What bring me here

The strong interest engagned through my own self-care journey, it has led me in further learning in keen to understand how our lymphatic system works, after having followed a method of dry brushing for some years from Ayurvedic technique to improve my body's lymphatic flow, it shows neurological health benefits. In 2024, I undertook programmes from MYOS Opleidingen, accredited training institute in Utrecht. MYOS Opleidingen offers short lines to various examining bodies for massage therapy, lymph therapy and sports therapy. To widely broadening my horizon my basical medical knowledgement, the full study of human anatomy, phsyiology and pahtology, is part of my study to deeper understanding of how our body functions and how to work with improvements for the best results.

Dr. Vodderâ€™s Manual Lymph Drainage  is the method of my present training at Myos Opleidingen6 which I am learning and following, aiming to become a certified lymphology therapist (by mid-April 2025). Thank You for your support and being part of my learning journey, this will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. Regularly re-training will be part of my continuous professional developments with the purpose of keep up my expertise and to learn new techniques to be able to treat (future) patients with lymphoedema (swelling) & lipoedema (fatty tissue) issues. 


It is with the subtile movments, in guiding your inner lymphatic stream back to its balance

Happy Lymph = Healthier Immunity
