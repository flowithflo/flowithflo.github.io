### What brings me here

The aspiration engaged through my own self-care journey, after having followed a method of dry brushing for some years from Ayurvedic technique to improve my body's lymphatic flow, it shows not only neurological health advantages, immunity responses benefits and more. 
It has led me keenly in further learning wanting to know how our lymphatic system works.
In 2024, I began two parallel studies in the program of lymph therapy (MYOS Opleidingen, the accredited training institute in Utrecht) and the program of basic medical knowledge, to widely broadening my horizon in human anatomy, physiology and pathology (TCMA, Traditional Chinese Medicine Academie Nederland). Both works hand in hand for a fuller deep understanding of how our body functions and how to work with for the best bet.

Dr. Vodderâ€™s Manual Lymph Drainage is the method of my present training at Myos Opleidingen that I am learning and following, aiming to become a certified lymphology therapist (by mid-April 2025). 
With your support and being part of my learning journey as my models, I wanted to say THANK YOU. This will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. Regularly re-training will be part of my continuous professional developments with the purpose of keep up my expertise and to learn new techniques to be able to treat (future) patients with lymphoedema (swelling) & lipoedema (fatty tissue) issues. 


Asid from my studies, I am a volunteer at the ACCESS/Utrecht International Centre at the municipality of Utrecht assisting non-native speakers living in Utrecht.
To keep myself in a good balance, any physical exercises such as stretching yoga, easy qigong, core pilates and racket sport are part self-care routins as my psychological needs to visit museums and spend time with my lovely family and friends!
