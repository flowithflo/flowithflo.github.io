Nice to see you here! My name is Flora. 


Dr. Vodderâ€™s Manual Lymph Drainage  is the method of my present training at Myos Opleidingen6 which I am learning and following, aiming to become a certified lymphology therapist (by mid-April 2025). Thank You for your support and being part of my learning journey, this will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. Regularly re-training will be part of my continuous professional developments with the purpose of keep up my expertise and to learn new techniques to be able to treat (future) patients with lymphoedema (swelling) & lipoedema (fatty tissue) issues. 

It is with the subtile movments, in guiding your inner lymphatic stream back to its balance
Happy Lymph = Healthier Immunity


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
