Nice to have you here! My name is Flora. 

### What brings me here

The aspiration engagned through my own self-care journey, after having followed a method of dry brushing for some years from Ayurvedic technique to improve my body's lymphatic flow, it shows not only neurological health advantages, immunity responses benefits and more. This has led me keenly in further learning wanting to know how our lymphatic system works.
In 2024, I begain two parallel studies in the program of lymph therapy (manuele lymphatic drainage) from MYOS Opleidingen (the accredited training institute in Utrecht) and of the basic medical knowledge, to widely broadening my horizon in human anatomy, phsyiology and pahtology with TCMA (Traditional Chinese Medicine Academie Nederland) for a full deeper understanding of how our body functions and how to work with for the best bet.

Dr. Vodderâ€™s Manual Lymph Drainage  is the method of my present training at Myos Opleidingen6 which I am learning and following, aiming to become a certified lymphology therapist (by mid-April 2025). Thank You for your support and being part of my learning journey, this will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. Regularly re-training will be part of my continuous professional developments with the purpose of keep up my expertise and to learn new techniques to be able to treat (future) patients with lymphoedema (swelling) & lipoedema (fatty tissue) issues.
