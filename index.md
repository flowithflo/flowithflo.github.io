<br> HELLO, I'm Flora! <br>

**THE PROCESS OF planting seeds AND habits** <br>
About 5 years ago, the aspiration engaged through my own self-care journey in manual lymph drainage, after having followed a method of dry brushing from Ayurvedic technique that is to improve my body's lymphatic flow, it shows not only neurological health advantages, immunity responses benefits and more. (Like many of us, the chapters of life through my own journey also has changed, I've switched career from an interior architecture designer to became a stay-at-home mum.) The fresh discover of manual lymph drainage (MLD) has led me keenly in further learning wanting to know how our lymphatic system works. I began to dive in to do some reserach about the MLD and this so-described as 'sewerage system', the lymphatic system. I still could feel the feeling of being excited when I found out locally there is a functional wellness, sports and therapy education. Without any doubts, I signed myself up for the very next available enrollment. That has been a year ago, now I'm more than half way through my diploma training promgram in lymphotherapy. Here, I'm excited to share with you what MLD is and what the benefits would bring for your inner network of all biological systems for an enhanced coordination between [Lymphoid System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7orwMgTQ5I&t=6s), immune system, neuroimmune, endocrine system, respiratory system, digestive system and much more. 
<br>
In Fall 2024, I began two parallel studies in the program of lymph therapy (learning line II)  *[MYOS Opleidingen, the accredited training institute in Utrecht](https://myosopleidingen.nl/opleiding/lymfedrainage/)* and the program of basic medical knowledge, to widely broadening my horizon in human anatomy, physiology and pathology *[TCMA, Traditional Chinese Medicine Academie Nederland](https://tcma.nl/medische-basiskennis/)*. 
Both works hand in hand for a fuller deep understanding of how our body functions and how to work with for the best bet.
<br>

Aside from the current training and to keep myself in a good balance, any physical exercises such as stretching yoga, easy qigong, core pilates and racket sport are part the self-care routins as well as my psychological needs in frequently visiting museums and spending time with my lovely family and friends!
<br> I love supporting [ACCESS/Utrecht International Centre](https://access-nl.org/partner/expat-center-utrecht/) at the municipality of Utrecht and assisting non-native speakers living in [Utrecht](https://www.discover-utrecht.com/).<br>

I'd also like to share how you can help to take care of your lymph at home and of course, you can contact me for a MLD experience (see the contact in below).
<br>
So, let's GO with FLO-W! 
<br>
The FLOW of your inner stream!
