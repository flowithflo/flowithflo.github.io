**THE PROCESS OF PLANTING SEEDS AND HABITS** <br>
About 5 years ago, the aspiration engaged through my own self-care voyage, it then has planted the seed for a deeper intuition. As a mother nurturing of her child and the household day-in & day-out, like the majority of motherhood, the chapters of life through my own journey also have altered, as from the occupation of being an interior designer and a specialized curator for a range of clients with their selective retro/ vintage products. I often wondered what is left for myself - my energy and my own health? I was constantly feeling having brain fog, tired easily and less able to engage with outdoor activities. 

One evening, I came across a method of take caring oneself in the most simplest way, the [dry brushing](https://nourished.nl/en/blogs/news/the-benefits-of-dry-body-brushing). Ayurvedic technique that is showed to improve the body's lymphatic flow, neurological health advantages, immunity responses benefits and more. 
The fresh discover of manual lymph drainage (MLD) has led me keenly in further learning wanting to know how our lymphatic system works. I started to dive in to do some research about the MLD and its relation with the so-described as 'sewerage system'; our lymphatic system.

I still could feel the feeling of being excited when I found out locally there is a functional wellness, sports and therapy education. Without any doubts, I signed myself up for the very next available enrollment. That has been a year ago, now I'm more than half way through my diploma training program in lymph therapy. Here, I'm excited to share with you what MLD is and what the benefits would bring for your inner network of all biological systems for an enhanced coordination between [Lymphoid System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7orwMgTQ5I&t=6s), immune system, [neuroimmune](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27608759/), [endocrine system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyl9gi0PnW8), respiratory system, [digestive system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352345X18301772?__cf_chl_tk=JGHL5qM5aGJyagsNZTS0f6JIsqF2orqsP0ififnQUfk-1740942359-1.0.1.1-P1C_sL9r3Mj6yNzKi1MRRBIqd465qj5q3tLB4BSdH0I) and much more that sounds so humble that we have the control over our health back to a neutral balance!
<br>
Half way through the late summer of 2024, I began two parallel studies in the program of lymph therapy (learning line II)  *[MYOS Opleidingen, the accredited training institute in Utrecht](https://myosopleidingen.nl/opleiding/lymfedrainage/)* and the program of basic medical knowledge, to widely broadening my horizon in human anatomy, physiology and pathology *[TCMA, Traditional Chinese Medicine Academie Nederland](https://tcma.nl/medische-basiskennis/)*. 
Both works hand in hand for a fuller profound understanding of how our body functions and how to work with it for the best bet.
<br>

Aside from the current training and keeping myself in an encouraging harmony, a little of physical exercises such as stretching Yoga, easy Qigong, core Pilates and racket sport are part the self-care routines along with my psychological needs in frequently visiting museums and spending time with my lovely family and close friends!
<br> I enjoy being able to give back to the community and part of my volunteering is with [ACCESS/Utrecht International Centre](https://access-nl.org/partner/expat-center-utrecht/) at the municipality of Utrecht and assisting non-native speakers living in [Utrecht](https://www.discover-utrecht.com/).<br> You may also hear me often tag on the conversations related to conscious living and enchanting [B Corp]( https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/) companies – part of my striving core values.    


Share with me if our self-care journey is aliened, I’m delightful to hear from you! 
<br>
So, let's GO with FLO-W! 
<br>
The FLOW of your inner stream!
