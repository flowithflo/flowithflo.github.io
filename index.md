THE PROCESS OF planting seeds AND habits <br>
About 5 years ago, the aspiration engaged through my own self-care journey in manuel lymph drainage, After having followed a method of dry brushing for some years from Ayurvedic technique to improve my body's lymphatic flow, it shows not only neurological health advantages, immunity responses benefits and more. Like many others, through our own journey, chapters of life changes, I've siwtched career from an interior architecture designer to became a stay-at-home mum. The fresh discover of manuel lymph drainage (MLD) has led me keenly in further learning wanting to know how our lymphatic system works. I begain to dive in to do some reserach about the MLD and this so-discribed as 'sewerage system', the lymphatic system. I still could feel the feeling of being excited when I found out locally there is a functional education in welness, sports and thearpy. With out any doubts, I signed myself up for the very next available enrollment. That has been a year ago, now I'm more than half way through my diploma training promgram in lymphotherapy. Here, I'm excited to share with you what MLD is and what the benefits would bring for your inner network of all biological systems for an enhanced cordination between [Lymphoid System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7orwMgTQ5I&t=6s), immune system, neuroimmunity, endoocrine system, respiratory system, digestive system and much more. 
<br>
Aside from the current training and to keep myself in a good balance, any physical exercises such as stretching yoga, easy qigong, core pilates and racket sport are part the self-care routins as well as my psychological needs in frequently visiting museums and spending time with my lovely family and friends!
<br> I love supporting [ACCESS/Utrecht International Centre](https://access-nl.org/partner/expat-center-utrecht/) at the municipality of Utrecht and assisting non-native speakers living in [Utrecht](https://www.discover-utrecht.com/).<br>

I'd also like to share how you can help to take care of your lymph at home and of course, you can contact me for a MLD experience (see the contact in below).

So, let's GO with FLO-W! 
<br>
The FLOW of your inner stream!


In 2024, I began two parallel studies in the program of lymph therapy  *[MYOS Opleidingen, the accredited training institute in Utrecht](https://myosopleidingen.nl/opleiding/lymfedrainage/)* and the program of basic medical knowledge, to widely broadening my horizon in human anatomy, physiology and pathology *[TCMA, Traditional Chinese Medicine Academie Nederland](https://tcma.nl/medische-basiskennis/)*. 
Both works hand in hand for a fuller deep understanding of how our body functions and how to work with for the best bet.
