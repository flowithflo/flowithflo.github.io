### Manuel lymph drainage
Developed in 1930s, by Dr. Emil Voldder2 (Danish physician). 
An extremely light skin (-stretch) physiotherapy hand technique, a very gentle form of slow method that applies systematic and rhythmically with the pumping performance in one direction movement. Repeating the movements several times results in an increased flow rate that will improve the lymph vessels to promote the excess fluids out of the tissue into the lymphatic pathways. 

Lymph in Latin is as Lympha, it means clear water
Lymph is as the unseen protector in our body, like the security guard, constantly checking the outside invaders. The lymphatic system is one of eleven organ systems in our body, it runs through like many small streams flowing towards a river. It has a vast circulatory network and is second to our cardiovascular system. It is an integral part of our immune system as well as the nervous system, the digestive system and the neurological system. 

The lymph nodes are found in most our body joints (allow movement in one direction of our body towards our heart), like in our head, neck, armpits and other parts of our body, where each opening treatment begins at neck area. Following the drainage paths that lymphatic fluid will be collected by our body’s largest lymphatic vessel and returning to the bloodstream near the neck at the left subclavian (lower collarbone) vein. These 500-600 filter stations work continuously to prevent (reduce) harmful pathogens from forming in our body in our everyday life. 

With the specific light pressure strokes apply for any conditions (normal people to pre-surgery and post-surgery patients) that almost everyone can benefit from it.
A +/- 30~40 minutes-per-session is usually counselled as a first-time participant and gradually increases or decreases the duration in the following sessions. Small adjustment may necessitate differently upon the time of your health condition. This technique mainly focuses on your lymph, not on body tissues and muscles. Moving toxins through the body isn’t always comfortable at first since lymph will continue to circulate for a while after the treatment (Usually, the effect of lymphatic drainage lasts about 24 hours.) A set of three treatments primarily, once in a week or ten days as sequence, allowing the ability to heal and your immune system to respond. 



Simple self-care at home can be done by breathing deeply4 and exercising5.
(Inhale as expanding your belly and exhale to relaxing your belly, several times per day.)
