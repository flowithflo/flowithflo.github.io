Dr. Vodderâ€™s Manual Lymph Drainage is the method of my present training at Myos Opleidingen that I am learning and following, aiming to become a certified lymphology therapist (by mid-April 2025). 
With your support and being part of my learning journey as my models, I wanted to say THANK YOU. This will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. Regularly re-training will be part of my continuous professional developments with the purpose of keep up my expertise and to learn new techniques to be able to treat (future) patients with lymphoedema (swelling) & lipoedema (fatty tissue) issues.
