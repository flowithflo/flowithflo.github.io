### What brings me here

Living in The Netherlands. Orginally born in Taiwan, teenlife raised in Canada and worked in China. Like many others, through our own journey, chapters of life changes, I've siwtched career from an interior architecture design to became a stay-at-home mum. About 5 years ago, the aspiration engaged through my own self-care journey, after having followed a method of dry brushing for some years from Ayurvedic technique to improve my body's lymphatic flow, it shows not only neurological health advantages, immunity responses benefits and more. 
It has led me keenly in further learning wanting to know how our lymphatic system works.
In 2024, I began two parallel studies in the program of lymph therapy  *[MYOS Opleidingen, the accredited training institute in Utrecht](https://myosopleidingen.nl/opleiding/lymfedrainage/)* and the program of basic medical knowledge, to widely broadening my horizon in human anatomy, physiology and pathology *[TCMA, Traditional Chinese Medicine Academie Nederland](https://tcma.nl/medische-basiskennis/)*. Both works hand in hand for a fuller deep understanding of how our body functions and how to work with for the best bet.

Aside from the current training and to keep myself in a good balance, any physical exercises such as stretching yoga, easy qigong, core pilates and racket sport are part the self-care routins as well as my psychological needs in frequently visiting museums and spending time with my lovely family and friends!
<br> I love supporting [ACCESS/Utrecht International Centre](https://access-nl.org/partner/expat-center-utrecht/) at the municipality of Utrecht and assisting non-native speakers living in [Utrecht](https://www.discover-utrecht.com/).
