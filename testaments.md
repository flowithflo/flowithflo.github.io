OTHER SAYS THAT
#### I had the pleasure to be introduced to Manual Limphatic Drainage for the first time by Flora Hung. Flora welcomed me very warmly, in a quiet and serene environment. She was extremely professional, and explained all the basic concepts to me. Flora had a very soft and kind touch, and I left the session feeling happy and lighter. I would definitely recommend Flora to anyone who is considering MLD treatments or exploring how to improve other health conditions that could be addressed by MLD. - Natália Leal 17-01-2025


THANK YOU,
with your support and being part of my learning journey as my models. 
<br>This will not only enhance on my practical skills to perform specific techniques and as well as the theoretical expertise relating pathological conditions. 
Let's Flow with Flora!
