With your support and being part of my learning journey as my models, I wanted to say THANK YOU. 
<br>This will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. 
<br>I hope you are looking forward to get your first MLD & let’s flow with Flo 

OTHER SAYS THAT...
#### I had the pleasure to be introduced to Manual Limphatic Drainage for the first time by Flora Hung. Flora welcomed me very warmly, in a quiet and serene environment. She was extremely professional, and explained all the basic concepts to me. Flora had a very soft and kind touch, and I left the session feeling happy and lighter. I would definitely recommend Flora to anyone who is considering MLD treatments or exploring how to improve other health conditions that could be addressed by MLD. - Natália Leal 17-01-2025
