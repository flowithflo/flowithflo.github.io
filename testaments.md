With your support and being part of my learning journey as my models, I wanted to say THANK YOU. This will not only enhance on my theoretical expertise relating to the lymphatic system but also as well as practical skills to perform specific techniques. Regularly re-training will be part of my continuous professional developments with the purpose of keep up my expertise and to learn new techniques to be able to treat (future) patients with lymphoedema (swelling) & lipoedema (fatty tissue) issues. 

#### I had the pleasure to be introduced to Manual Limphatic Drainage for the first time by Flora Hung. Flora welcomed me very warmly, in a quiet and serene environment. She was extremely professional, and explained all the basic concepts to me. Flora had a very soft and kind touch, and I left the session feeling happy and lighter. I would definitely recommend Flora to anyone who is considering MLD treatments or exploring how to improve other health conditions that could be addressed by MLD. - Natália Leal 17-01-2025







#### Happy Lymph = Healthier Immunity
I hope you are looking forward to get your first MLD & let’s flow with Flo
